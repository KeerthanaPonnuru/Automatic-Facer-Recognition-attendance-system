# Automatic-Facer-Recognition-attendance-system

Identifying web cam images of students in a college, for attendance by linking code with the time-table. First the student's face is trained and in
real-time testing it detects the faces. Details such as date, time, student name, faculty name and subject
name are then stored in a csv file. The settings are such that the attendance will be marked from a 10 minutes time
interval before and after the class time. Also detects the students with less than 75% attendance.
